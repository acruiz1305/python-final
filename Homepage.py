Description:

This program analyzes the top 2000 global companies with various charts and graphs. It explores
different features such as looking at the top 10, a map with their location, a scatterplot, distribution
plot, pie chart, bar charts and more! Some even include an analysis of what the data signifies. There
are interactive features, such as the map, a quiz, panda dataframe, bar chart and more. It also has
different web pages for organization. It includes modules learned in class and three extras: CSV, Seaborn
and Plotly Express. This program shows the capabilities of python and coding. I hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Š
